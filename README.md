# Math-Popularization-Program

Produced by the Free Mathematicians Consortium (FMC)

Break the traditional perception of mathematics and create a new mathematical learning environment and method.<br>

### Tip.

For your reading experience, please use typora after downloading the tutorial(.md format) Open and check

### Become a content provider

You can submit some textbooks (.md format) in pull request, but you need to indicate the content of the textbook, the date, and as easy to understand as possible, and submit to the appropriate board, uniformly write the title in the first line with three headings, and in the second line with six headings "Auther:(your name)", and try to use Typora to write, and also upload the content of the video textbook (only .mp4) or create a new board.

### Become a translator

We encourage everyone to actively participate in the localization of these materials to help people with the same native language as themselves to learn them better. For localization, please create a folder under the appropriate module with the name of this language as an acronym, e.g. "zh-cn" for Chinese. And use the title of the translated content directly without changing it, and put it in the appropriate language folder.
